## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit .env file with your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### 2. Start with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Or Start Locally
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
python run.py
```

### 4. Access the Platform
- Main Interface: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- Status: http://localhost:8000/status
